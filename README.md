Explanation:
This screenshot represents the MCP Server workflow, which is triggered after the site visit is confirmed.

The workflow:

Receives structured booking data

Appends a new row into Google Sheets

Stores booking details reliably for future use

This separates business logic and data storage, making the system scalable.
